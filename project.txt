Explanation:

main.py:
    Initializes the application.
    Handles login logic.
    Opens the appropriate window based on user authentication.
gui/:
    Contains modules for each GUI window/page.
    Each module defines the layout and functionality of the corresponding window.
    Uses either Tkinter or PyQt for GUI elements.
login_window.py:
    GUI for the login page.
    Handles user input (admin/doctor login).
    Verifies credentials against stored, securely hashed passwords.
patient_list.py:
    Displays the list of patients.
    Implements search/filter functionality.
    Allows navigation to patient_view.py or patient_edit.py.
patient_view.py, patient_edit.py, patient_add.py:
    GUI and logic for viewing, editing, and adding patient records.
    Interact with data_manager.py to load, save, and encrypt/decrypt data.
data_manager.py:
    Crucial Module: Handles all file I/O and encryption/decryption.
    Functions:
        load_patient_data(patient_id): Loads and decrypts patient data from the file.
        save_patient_data(patient_id, data): Encrypts and saves patient data to the file.
        create_patient_file(patient_id, initial_data): Creates a new encrypted file for a new patient.
patient.py:
    Defines a Patient class to represent patient data.
    Attributes: ID, name, date of birth, and other relevant information.
utils.py (Optional):
    For any helper functions that don't fit into other modules.
patient_data/:
    Directory where encrypted patient files (patient_ID.enc) are stored.
    Important: This directory should have appropriate access permissions to protect patient data.

GUI Framework Choice (Tkinter vs. PyQt):

Tkinter:
    Simpler to learn and use.
    Good for basic GUI applications.
    Might be sufficient for this project.
PyQt:
    More powerful and feature-rich.
    Offers more flexibility in GUI design.
    Consider if you need more advanced GUI elements or customization.


Remember:

Security: Implement robust encryption and key management in data_manager.py.
Privacy: Adhere to relevant data protection regulations.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling throughout the application.
This structure provides a good starting point. You can adjust it based on your specific needs and preferences as you develop the application.

main.py:

import hashlib  # For password hashing (you can use bcrypt or Argon2 instead)
from gui import login_window, patient_list 

# (Import other GUI modules as you create them)

def main():
    """Main application entry point."""

    # --- Configuration (You can move this to a separate config file) ---
    ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH = "your_hashed_admin_password"  # Hash the password securely!
    DOCTOR_PASSWORD_HASH = "your_hashed_doctor_password"  # Hash the password securely!

    # --- Login Handling ---
    login_successful = False
    while not login_successful:
        login_type, entered_password = login_window.show_login_window()

        if login_type == "admin":
            if hashlib.sha256(entered_password.encode()).hexdigest() == ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH:
                login_successful = True
                user_type = "admin"
            else:
                login_window.show_error_message("Incorrect password!")
        elif login_type == "doctor":
            if hashlib.sha256(entered_password.encode()).hexdigest() == DOCTOR_PASSWORD_HASH:
                login_successful = True
                user_type = "doctor"
            else:
                login_window.show_error_message("Incorrect password!")
        else:
            # Handle case where login window is closed
            return  

    # --- Main Application Loop ---
    if login_successful:
        # Open the patient list window after successful login
        patient_list.show_patient_list_window(user_type)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation:

Import Necessary Modules:

Import hashlib for password hashing (replace with bcrypt or argon2 for stronger hashing).
Import the necessary GUI modules (replace placeholders with actual module names).
Configuration:

Important: Replace the placeholder password hashes (ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH, DOCTOR_PASSWORD_HASH) with securely hashed passwords. Do not store passwords in plain text!
Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.
Example using bcrypt:

import bcrypt
hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(b"your_password", bcrypt.gensalt())


Login Handling:

login_successful Flag: Controls the login loop.
Login Loop: Continuously prompts for login until successful.
login_window.show_login_window(): (You need to implement this in gui/login_window.py)
Displays the login window and returns the login type ("admin" or "doctor") and the entered password.
Password Verification:
Hashes the entered password using the same algorithm used for storing the password.
Compares the hash with the stored hash.
Error Handling: Displays an error message if the password is incorrect.
Main Application Loop:

patient_list.show_patient_list_window(): (You need to implement this in gui/patient_list.py)
Displays the main patient list window if the login is successful.
Key Points:

Security:
Password Hashing: Use a strong hashing algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2) and never store passwords in plain text.
Input Validation: Implement input validation in your GUI modules to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection (even though you're not using a database, it's a good practice).
GUI Implementation: You'll need to create the GUI modules (login_window.py, patient_list.py, etc.) and implement the functions called from main.py.
Error Handling: Add more robust error handling (e.g., for file operations in data_manager.py).
This main.py provides a basic structure. You'll need to build upon it by implementing the GUI, encryption, and other features in separate modules.

Okay, I can help you create the login window GUI with Tkinter, including your specific requirements:

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
from PIL import Image, ImageTk  # For handling images

class LoginWindow:
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master
        master.title("Patient Records App")

        # --- Background Image ---
        try:
            # Replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the actual path
            self.bg_image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open('path/to/your/image.jpg')) 
            self.bg_label = tk.Label(master, image=self.bg_image)
            self.bg_label.place(x=0, y=0, relwidth=1, relheight=1)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("Background image not found. Using default background.")

        # --- Welcome Label ---
        self.welcome_label = tk.Label(master, text="Welcome Jaqueline Sim√µes", 
                                      font=("Helvetica", 16))
        self.welcome_label.pack(pady=(100, 20))  # Adjust padding as needed

        # --- Password Entry ---
        self.password_label = tk.Label(master, text="Password:", font=("Helvetica", 12))
        self.password_label.pack()

        self.password_entry = ttk.Entry(master, show="*")  # Use ttk.Entry for better styling
        self.password_entry.pack(pady=10)

        # --- Login Button ---
        self.login_button = ttk.Button(master, text="Login", command=self.login)
        self.login_button.pack()

    def login(self):
        # TODO: Implement password verification logic here
        password = self.password_entry.get()
        print("Entered Password:", password)
        # ... (Add your password checking and application logic)

root = tk.Tk()
login_window = LoginWindow(root)
root.mainloop()

Explanation:

Import Modules:

Import tkinter as tk for the GUI.
Import ttk from tkinter for themed widgets (better appearance).
Import Image and ImageTk from PIL to handle the background image.
LoginWindow Class:

__init__ Method:

Create the main window (master).
Background Image:
Load the image using Image.open() and ImageTk.PhotoImage().
Create a label (self.bg_label) to display the image.
Use place() to position the image (covers the entire window).
Important: Replace "path/to/your/image.jpg" with the actual path to your image file.
Welcome Label: Create and position the welcome label.
Password Entry: Create a label and an entry field (masked with show="*") for the password.
Login Button: Create a button that will trigger the login method when clicked.
login Method:

Placeholder: This method is currently a placeholder.
You need to implement your password verification logic here:
Get the password from self.password_entry.get().
Hash the entered password using a secure hashing algorithm (bcrypt or Argon2).
Compare the hashed password with the stored hash for the correct user.
If the password is correct, proceed to the main application window.
If incorrect, display an error message.
Create and Run the Window:

Create the main Tkinter window (root).
Create an instance of the LoginWindow class.
Run the Tkinter event loop using root.mainloop().
To Use:

Replace "path/to/your/image.jpg" with the correct path to your image file.
Implement the password verification logic in the login method.
Run the code to see your customized login window.
This code provides a basic structure for your login window. You can customize it further by adding more styling, error handling, and your specific application logic.

Yes, it's definitely possible to compile your Python code (including Tkinter GUIs) into a standalone .exe file that can be run on Windows PCs without requiring the user to have Python installed.

Here are the two most popular tools for creating .exe files from Python code:

PyInstaller:

Advantages:
Widely used and well-documented.
Relatively easy to use, especially for simpler projects.
Good support for various Python libraries, including Tkinter.
How to use it:
Install: Open your command prompt or terminal and run: pip install pyinstaller
Navigate to Project Directory: Use the cd command to go to the folder containing your main Python script.
Run PyInstaller: Execute a command like: pyinstaller --onefile your_main_script.py
Replace your_main_script.py with the actual name of your main Python file.
The --onefile option creates a single executable file, which is generally more convenient for distribution.
Executable Location: PyInstaller will create a dist folder in your project directory, and your .exe file will be inside.
cx_Freeze:

Advantages:
Can be a good choice for more complex projects or if you need more fine-grained control over the build process.
How to use it:
cx_Freeze requires a bit more setup than PyInstaller. You'll need to create a setup script.
Refer to the cx_Freeze documentation for detailed instructions: https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Important Considerations:

Dependencies: If your project uses external libraries (other than Tkinter, which is usually included), you'll need to make sure those libraries are bundled with your .exe. Both PyInstaller and cx_Freeze have mechanisms for handling this.
Icon: You can add a custom icon to your .exe file. PyInstaller and cx_Freeze have options for specifying an icon file.
Testing: Always test your compiled .exe on a clean Windows machine (one without Python installed) to ensure it works correctly.
